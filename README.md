# NTLSRU-Net

Codes for our submission to Scientific Data, entitled "A global annual simulated VIIRS nighttime light dataset from 1992 to 2023".

The code and scripts is used for the cross-sensor calibration between DMSP NTL data and VIIRS NTL data with a Nighttime Light  U-Net super-resolution network (NTLSRU-Net).
Detailed information about these codes is coming soon.
